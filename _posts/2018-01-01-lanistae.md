Basically, Lanistae was a project I wanted to show off on. When I was 16, I was really wanted to have my own startup. Iâ€™ve done a lot of apps, websites or these other small projects in the past but it was either just a short experiment I worked on for just a few weeks or a client's order.

At first, I wanted Lanistae to be a place where golfers can meet some other, more experienced golfers who can make their swing better. Having golf coach is really really expensive these days and at every golf club, there is just so much golfer that can just get the job done or even perfect for a really low price. It was like an Uber of golf coaches (everyone's uber of something these days :D).
So I've started to research this thing, ways to market it, target customers, how big it could be... then I did this basic MVP prototype on my phone and it looked amazing! I got me thinking that focusing just on golf might not be the best idea because you can find these "really experienced amateurs" in almost every sport. For example weightlifting, tennis, bowling, etc. - it doesn't matter. So I included those and made it universal. Than I started coding a web app with the idea that it would be monetized by google ads and paid promotions of some profiles to make them stand out.

From the very beginning, I wanted this to be my signature project - I wanted to design everything by myself, market it, do all the copywriting and code it without any external code that would make the process easier. And I guess did it good (considering my age). It took me few months, had to redo the whole front-end once which was a pain in the ass, program all the back-end monetizing system even though I didn't end up using it (legal reasons) and I got it touch with almost every sports coach in my country. Looking back I would say that I would do a lot of things differently - not just the technical side but the ways I interacted with people or pivoted the idea. But overall I think that this project pushed me a lot further, almost more than anything in my life so far in terms of work ethic and patience with my own thoughts.

 The hardest thing was definitely designing my own search engine algorithm specifically for my own SQL database... I almost died but it's perfect </3
